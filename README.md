# Anomaly Detection

# Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a given dataset using machine learning techniques. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, which can be useful in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance.

 ## Installation
To get started with this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the anomaly detection script, use the following command:

bash
Copy
python detect_anomalies.py --input data/input_data.csv --output results/anomalies.csv
Arguments
--input: Path to the input dataset file (CSV format).

--output: Path to save the detected anomalies (CSV format).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in the data/ directory. It contains the following columns:

feature_1, feature_2, ..., feature_n: Numerical features used for anomaly detection.

timestamp: Timestamp for each record (optional).

### Dataset Description
Size: X rows, Y columns

### Source: [Link to dataset source or description]

## Methodology
The anomaly detection process involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

Model Selection: Using algorithms such as Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders.

Training: Training the model on the preprocessed data.

Detection: Identifying anomalies in the dataset.

Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Details
Algorithm: Autoencoder + LOF

Parameters:

n_estimators: 100

contamination: 0.01

## Results
The results of the anomaly detection are saved in the results/ directory. The output file contains the following columns:

anomaly_score: The anomaly score for each record.

is_anomaly: Binary indicator (1 for anomaly, 0 for normal).

## Evaluation Metrics
Precision: 20%

Recall: 98%

F1-Score: 33%
